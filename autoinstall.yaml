  # User creation can occur in one of 3 ways:
  # 1. Create a user using this `identity` section.
  # 2. Create users as documented in cloud-init inside the user-data section,
  #    which means this single-user identity section may be removed.
  # 3. Prompt for user configuration on first boot.  Remove this identity
  #    section and see the "Installation without a default user" section.
  #identity:
  #  realname: ''
  #  username: sxmadmin
    # A password hash is needed. `mkpasswd --method=SHA-512` can help.
